pig-mode is an Emacs major mode for editing Pig scripts. Currently
it supports syntax highlighting and indentation for Pig versions
0.2 to 0.11.1. We track the changes to Pig syntax and try to
support new Pig features ASAP.

Installation:

Put this file into your Emacs lisp path (eg. site-lisp) and add the
following line to your ~/.emacs file:

  (require 'pig-mode)
